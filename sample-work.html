              <h2>Redacted Dashboard (Example)</h2>
              <p>
                A board doesn’t need every data column. They need the signal: demand, coverage, and implications.
                This is the visual style we use to keep attention on decisions.
              </p>

              <div class="sample-frame">
                <strong>Placeholder dashboard modules:</strong>
                <ul class="list">
                  <li>Calls by hour/day</li>
                  <li>Peak overlap windows</li>

              <h2>Sample Staffing Curve</h2>
              <p>
                A staffing curve shows when coverage is “adequate,” “tight,” or “under pressure,” based on call demand.
                It turns “we feel busy” into a chart a board can understand.

                <code>
Peak demand occurs 10:00–14:00 and 17:00–20:00.
The proposed schedule option increases overlap during peak windows
without increasing total staffed hours.

              <h2>Board Slide Excerpt (Example)</h2>
              <p>
                Slides are designed for public meetings: fewer words, clearer visuals, and a direct line from
                finding → impact → options.
              </p>

                <code>
1) What changed?
- Call demand increased in weekday mid-day windows.

2) Why it matters
- Peak overlaps increased; coverage strain shows up as delayed availability.

3) Options
A) Adjust shift overlap (no additional headcount)
B) Add part-time peak coverage (targeted hours)
C) Maintain status quo (documented risk)

              <h2>“What a Board Actually Sees”</h2>
              <p>
                Boards respond to clarity: what we know, how we know it, and what the options are.
                The goal is defensible decision-making, not technical impressiveness.
              </p>

              <div class="sample-frame">
                <strong>Example board-ready summary paragraph:</strong>
                <code>
Based on CAD/RMS demand patterns and staffing schedules provided,
peak call overlap occurs most frequently during weekday mid-day periods.
The recommended coverage option improves peak overlap coverage while
keeping total staffed hours flat. This recommendation is supported by
validated call volume distributions and documented assumptions.
