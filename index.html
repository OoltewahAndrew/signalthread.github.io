      <p class="st-note">
        Public safety data is created through years of operations, across multiple
        systems and vendors. As organizations evolve, that information naturally
        becomes fragmented or loses context.
        We help bring those pieces back together so the data reflects how the
        organization operates today.

          <div>
            <strong>Gather</strong>
            <p>
              We start by understanding where the data comes from, how it has been used,
              and why it exists in its current form.

          <div>
            <strong>Interpret</strong>
            <p>
              We reconcile differences in structure, terminology, and historical usage
              so the information can be viewed consistently and accurately.

          </div>

          <div>
            <strong>Guide</strong>
            <p>
              We help organizations understand what the data can reliably support,
              where caution is warranted, and how to move forward with confidence.
