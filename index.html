    <p>
      We help public safety and local government organizations make operational data
      coherent, defensible, and usable — especially when it has grown across systems,
      time, and changing requirements.

      Public safety data is created through years of daily operations, across multiple
      systems, vendors, and policy changes. As organizations evolve, that information
      naturally becomes fragmented or loses context.
      Our role is to restore continuity so the data reflects how the organization
      actually operates today.

            We begin by understanding where the data comes from, how it was recorded,
            and the operational constraints under which it was created.
            This includes legacy systems, historical practices, and implicit assumptions.

        <div>
          <p>
            We reconcile differences in structure, terminology, and usage so information
            can be viewed consistently.
            Analysis is grounded in real workflows, not abstract models.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            We help organizations understand what the data can reliably support,
            where uncertainty remains, and how to move forward with clarity
            and fewer assumptions.
